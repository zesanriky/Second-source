Why Lecithin?<br> <br></br> Lecithin is the most accurate example of functionality and health combined in the same food ingredient.
It is naturally present in all living organisms as main constituent of cell membranes and due to its selective permeability; it is responsible of the passage of substances in and out of the cells. (Wikipedia link: membrane cell)

The word Lecithin (wikipedia link) is derived from the Greek word lekythos which means egg’s yolk and it was discovered for the first time in 1846 by the French chemist Théodore Nicolas Gobley  (Wikipedia  link) analyzing the eggs and the brain matter.
The primary commercial source of Lecithin comes from soybeans, only more recently it is available from other vegetable sources like sunflower and rapeseed.

<br> </br>
<br>Todays’ consumers are very conscious that food is directly related to their health:  Lecithin is the emulsifier of choice for the food industries, which want to offer healthy ingredients to the consumers.
AgroHorizon has the capability and the knowledge to give the best functionality to Lecithin required by the food industries in order to produce safe food with the desired properties.

<p class="ex1">

Lecithin Processing
After harvesting, soybeans are cleaned and conditioned. Then cracked, de-hulled and rolled into flakes.
Flakes are extracted to obtain the vegetable oil. The addition of water to the crude oil hydrates the phosphatides (the main components of Lecithin), making them oil-insoluble. The material is then dried and fluidized to produce standard grade Lecithin or used as source to produce more functional or easy-to-use products.

<br> </br>
</br>The composition of Lecithin can vary depending on its origin, processing (extraction method) and of course quality of the soybeans.
Lecithins can be enzymatically modified by hydrolyzing a fatty acid (Lyso-Lecithin): This modification gives a variety of new different properties to the Lecithin, extensively useful for the food industries.
Here is the main function of AgroHorizon: selecting the most appropriate Lecithins, controlling the analytical parameters and generating even more functional or flexible products by the addition of other ingredients.

<br> </br>
<strong><font color="#C8FE2E">Chemical Composition</font></strong>
<br> </br>
Chemically Lecithin is a mixtures of different phospholipids (Wikipedia link) presenting generally the structure of triglycerides, but one of the fatty acids being substituted by a functional group. Phospholipids consist mainly of Phosphatidylcholine (PC), Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), Phosphatidylinositol (PI) and Phosphatidic Acid (PA) combined with other minor phospholipids, glycolipids and other substances like triglycerides, sugars, tocopherols and free fatty acids.</p>

<p class="ex1">

<strong><font color="#C8FE2E">Functional Properties</font></strong>
<br> </br>
Lecithin is a mixture of surface-active agents. Most of the surfactant properties of Lecithin can be attributed to the phospholipids. These contain a hydrophobic (lipophilic) part with an affinity for fats and oils and a hydrophilic (lipophobic) part with an affinity for water. This double behaviour gives a strong surface activity to the Lecithin able to reduce the surface tension between immiscible liquids like water and oil (emulsification).
The emulsification properties of the different types of Lecithins can be assigned based on the well-known
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophilic-lipophilic_balance">hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB).</a> </p>

<br> 
<p class="ex"> <font size="3" color="#C8FE2E">Picture HLB</font><p align="middle;">
 </p>

<p class="ex1">

HLB reflects the size and the strength of the hydrophilic (the polar part of the molecule) and the lipophilic (the apolar or oil loving) groups on emulsifiers.
Due to the surface activity Lecithin can form stable O/W and W/O emulsions and stable dispersions with a wide range of uses.</p>

<p class="ex"> <font size="3" color="#C8FE2E">Picture emulsion </font><p align="middle;">
 </p>

<p class="ex1">
In addition to its emulsifying strength, Lecithin has the capacity to modify the rheology of sugars and fats due to its lubricity and viscosity reduction properties, by reducing the contact surface of incompatible solids, like in cream fillings and chocolate.

<br> </br>

<br> </br>

Lecithin is a source of unsaturated fatty acids especially linoleic (C18:2), precursors of Omega 3 and the most active source of choline, being associated to phospholipids (Phosphatidylcholine).
FDA has assigned to choline a RDI (Recommended Daily Intake) having recognized its functions in many biological functions. (Wikipedia link) 
Lecithin functionality was also studied in the 1980s in relation to cholesterol reduction, and a mechanism for transforming LDL cholesterol into HDL cholesterol was speculated.
Lecithin is a source of phosphorus and is rich of natural tocopherols (vitamin E) of up to 2000 mg/kg.</p></p>

How to Challenge our Thoughts ?<br>
Our Portfolio: Thinking Lecithin from Application <br></br> Lecithin is a high quality side-stream product of the vegetable oil milling industry. Lecithin makes the oil opaque and untransparent Thus, it has to be extracted from the vegetable oil. As a spin-off product, it is unfortunately often misunderstood. It is marketed in most cases, because the Lecithin-tank at the end of the day has to be empty.However, this perspective does not help the final user of Lecithins, whether he is a food producer or manufacturer of chemical/technical products.

<p class="ex1">
<br> 
Lecithin has to provide an ideal feature to the end-user, adapted to the needs of the finished product.
Are emulsification, flow-properties, the colour, the composition of Lecithin from the origin, the microbiology, the viscosity, GMO status, functionality with other ingredients (or many other features) matching the needs of the process?
If you just take the by-product of the oil mill (because it exists) into the focus, you will be unable to meet these diverse requirements of the customers.

<br> </br>
<br>AgroHorizon accurately wants to understand the application and customer needs to choose the Lecithin that suits you and your product. 
Not one Lecithin resembles another Lecithin. We are facing a natural resource that is obtained in very different ways from different global regions with different soils and from different plants. Many parameters of Lecithin extraction/separation affect the application in the final product.At this stage, AgroHorizon is launching its expertise. We analyze the client's needs and (after that) select the best suitable Lecithin.
<br> </br>

Never the reverse!
<br> </br>

Since AgroHorizon has no dependency to sell certain, available Lecithins, we can select the right material for you.
In addition, we are able (on top of the normal standardization) to customize and compound - even small lot sizes. 
Compliance with specific analytical characteristics (e.g. microbiology or contaminants) can be evaluated with us.

Challenge us. We have an extensive network of own and external expertise. 

We probably have a better answer to your questions than you got so far.
